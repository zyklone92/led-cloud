# LEDCloud

A Java program for the Raspberry Pi to control an LED-mesh, which is comprised of a WS281x LED-strip. It supports several different modes (such as random patterns travelling across the LED-array, an alarm mode, etc.), which can be set by the network.

Check the media-folder for photos and video-demonstrations as well as a complete class-diagram of the project structure.

Special thanks to mbelling (https://github.com/mbelling) for providing a wrapper around the rpi281x library for Java (https://github.com/rpi-ws281x/rpi-ws281x-java).
